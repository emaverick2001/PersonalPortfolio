      Hi, I'm Debashis. I'm a software engineer at Honeywell. I've previously worked at Garmin and
      Intel. I currently spend most of my time using Elixir, TypeScript, and Python, and I'm
      comfortable in other languages as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I completed my MS in Computer Science at Arizona State University, where I primarily studied
      cybersecurity: binary analysis and exploitation, reverse engineering, and network security.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-inside list-disc leading-relaxed">
      I've recently been exploring:
      <li>real-time distributed systems for music applications</li>
      <li>design and UX</li>
      <li>infrastructure as code</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'm also a classically-trained clarinetist, and I completed my BMus in Clarinet Performance at
      Arizona State University. I've studied with
      <Link href="https://www.selmer.fr/en/blogs/artistes/robert-spring">Dr. Robert Spring</Link>,
      <Link href="https://www.selmer.fr/en/blogs/artistes/joshua-gardner">Dr. Joshua Gardner</Link>,
      and
      <Link href="https://www.selmer.fr/en/blogs/artistes/stefanie-gardner">
        Dr. Stefanie Gardner
      </Link>. In addition to the clarinet, I play the bass clarinet, contra-alto clarinet, and
      contrabass clarinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and I repair musical instruments! I studied instrument repair with Dr. Steve Prescott, a
      well-known repairperson in the clarinet community. I primarily focus on clarinet repair,
      though I've done a bit of work on flutes and saxophones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my other interests include calisthenics, cooking, language learning, note-taking
      systems, ergonomic keyboards, type theory, (Neo)vim, Emacs, Linux, and NixOS.
