  <div class="mb-8 space-y-4">
    <p>
      In service of my arm and wrist health, I type on a
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <Link href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/">Kinesis Advantage360 Pro</Link>
      and customize my keymap with <Link href="https://zmk.dev/">ZMK</Link>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I previously used an <Link href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ</Link>
      with
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <Link href="https://mechkeys.com/products/ttc-flaming-purple-snow-mechanical-keyboard-switches?variant=43517493739743">TTC Flaming Purples</Link>.
      This keyboard was amazing - the Flaming Purples are a great typing experience, and the
      software from ZSA is incredibly well-done - but unfortunately, it didn't end up fixing my
      wrist issues in the same way as the Kinesis.
