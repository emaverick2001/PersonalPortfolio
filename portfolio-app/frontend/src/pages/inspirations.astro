  <PageHeader>Inspirations</PageHeader>

  <section class="space-y-4">
    <p>
      I've taken inspiration from quite a few different places. It's difficult to know in advance
      when something will inspire you, but it's a special feeling when you find something that does.
      While it's difficult to be exhaustive, this page lists out the largest influences that have
      shaped my perspective and inspired my creative work. It'll be more organized in the future, I
      promise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of these inspirations are recent, and many are from my childhood. I believe there's
      something important about holding on to the things that inspired us as children.
    </p>

    <div class="py-2">
      <blockquote class="mb-2 border-s-4 border-zinc-200 ps-2 italic text-zinc-900">
        Regardless of the circumstances, human capacity has its limits, and when too much happens,
        it’s easy to feel like giving up on our dreams. It's only natural to prioritize daily life;
        after all, it’s reality that gives rise to our dreams.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yet, as those dreams get worn down by the harshness of everyday life, I often hoped you could
        recall the dreams you had before facing those challenges. It may be presumptuous of me, but I
        believe that the aspirations you had as a child are incredibly important.
