            My research interests lie at the intersection of <strong>Graph Neural Networks</strong>, <strong>Agentic AI Systems</strong>, and <strong>Data Engineering</strong>. 
            I’m drawn to problems that require bridging structured data processing with intelligent reasoning systems — enabling more robust, personalized, and explainable learning experiences. 
            My current work spans from graph-based retrieval systems to data automation pipelines for clinical research.

        <p class="text-black">
      My long-term research vision focuses on building <strong>graph-based intelligent systems</strong> capable of structured reasoning, multi-hop retrieval, and personalized interaction. 
      I’m especially excited by opportunities that bridge machine learning, data engineering, and human-centered design — whether in education, research, or healthcare contexts.

    <!-- ULAB -->
    <h2 class="mb-2 mt-12 font-sans text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">U Lab — Graph Neural Networks & Intelligent Systems</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Directed by <strong>Professor Jiaxuan You</strong>, U Lab focuses on leveraging Graph Neural Networks for reasoning, representation learning, and multi-hop knowledge access. 
      Our work explores how graph structure can enable models to move beyond static prompts and towards structured, explainable intelligence.

    <h3 class="mb-2 font-sans text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">TinyTutor (Ideation)</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      TinyTutor is an early-stage research project that explores how graph-based reasoning can support <strong>adaptive tutoring systems</strong>. 
      The core idea is to create a graph-enhanced backbone that links concepts, dependencies, and skill progressions — enabling a small language model to act as an interactive, concept-aware tutor.
      I’m currently designing the system architecture, retrieval pipeline, and evaluation framework for multi-hop question answering and content personalization.

    <!-- CPCR -->
    <h2 class="mb-2 font-sans text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">Center for Psychedelic & Consciousness Research (CPCR)</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      At <strong>Johns Hopkins CPCR</strong>, my work centers on automating and scaling clinical research data workflows — from ingestion to reporting. 
      CPCR conducts world-leading psychedelic clinical trials, aiming to uncover therapeutic mechanisms and expand responsible psychedelic science. 
      My contributions focus on building reliable, reproducible systems to support researchers and clinicians.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 font-sans text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">QA Library</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      A centralized Python library that automates scoring for over <strong>100+ questionnaires and psychometric measures</strong> used in CPCR studies.
      It ensures reproducibility, version control, and harmonization of data across multiple clinical protocols.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 font-sans text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">PHI Redactor</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      A pipeline that <strong>automatically detects and redacts Protected Health Information (PHI)</strong> from unstructured text and tabular datasets. 
      This enables compliant downstream processing and model training on de-identified data.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 font-sans text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">Data Catalog System</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      An internal data management platform for organizing, distributing, and versioning scored study datasets. 
      This tool integrates tightly with the QA Library, AE/PD report generator, and other automation scripts to reduce manual overhead in research workflows.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 font-sans text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">Protocol Deviations + Adverse Events (AE/PD) Automation</h3>
    <p class="mb-6">
      A RedCap-based automation pipeline that ingests adverse event and protocol deviation data, 
      parses and harmonizes it, and generates <strong>human-readable HTML reports</strong> for IRB and clinical teams. 
      This reduced manual reporting time and improved standardization across studies.

    <!-- Toscano Lab -->
    <h2 class="mb-2 font-sans text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">Toscano Lab — Reactive Sulfur Species Chemistry</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      In <strong>Toscano Lab</strong>, I contributed to experimental research investigating the chemistry and biological roles of <strong>hydropersulfides</strong>. 
      Our work focused on developing reagents and methods to understand protein persulfidation and its biochemical effects.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 font-sans text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">Lab Work</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      • Developed and executed wet-lab protocols for hydropersulfide generation.<br/>
      • Contributed to characterization and analysis of reactive sulfur species.<br/>
      • Collaborated with interdisciplinary researchers to align experimental workflows with downstream data processing and visualization.
