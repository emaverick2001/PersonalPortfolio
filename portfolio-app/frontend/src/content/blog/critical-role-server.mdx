For this project, I self-host a media server with
[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org), set up [Tailscale](http://tailscale.com) to
securely access my server from anywhere, and write a script to quickly download
Critical Role episodes to the media server.

## Background

A couple of years ago, I watched the [first season of Critical
Role](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7atuZxmT954bCkC062rKwXTvJtcqFB8i). If
you haven't heard of it, the show features well-known voice actors playing
Dungeons and Dragons. They're all great at voices, accents, impressions,
storytelling, and improv, and it makes for an exciting show!

Each episode is anywhere between 2 and 4 hours long (it was originally a weekly
livestream), and the first season has about 115 episodes. It took me a while to
get through it, mostly while walking across campus during my master's degree.

I decided to watch [the second
season](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1tiwbzkOjQxD0jjAE7PsWoaCrs0EkBH2&si=jC5UJZD0Azj31FCR)
recently, but wanted a better way to sync my progress between devices, as I'll
often listen to the show while driving or in the background on desktop. YouTube
works, but doesn't always sync progress properly, and I didn't enjoy scrubbing
through 4-hour long videos when progress didn't sync. There is a podcast, but it
doesn't have the video, it's missing some content, and I found it frustrating to
scroll through my podcast app to find the show again whenever I wanted to
continue listening.

The goal: Critical Role Season 2, properly synced between devices. Continue
watching/listening with as close to one click as possible.

## The plan

At a high level, this is how I approached this project:

- Set up a server
- Install Tailscale for secure access
- Install Jellyfin for the media server
- Write a script to easily download show episodes into Jellyfin

## Acquiring a server

For the server, I decided to rent a VPS. I could have used an old computer, but
I've already done so on past projects and didn't want to do that here.

I'd normally use something like Linode or DigitalOcean, but media servers need
storage, and storage is expensive on these platforms. However, I recently saw a
[video from Dax Raad where he explains his remote development
setup](https://youtu.be/KQ2gz5i7VAA). In the video, he recommends looking for
VPS providers with desktop CPUs rather than server CPUs. Following this advice,
I found [Oplink](https://oplink.net) and rented a server with a Ryzen 9950x (one
vCPU), 4 GB memory, 100 GB of NVMe storage, and 10 TB of data transfer - all for
$7.95 a month.

You might argue that this is a bit expensive for one hobby project, or overkill
for a media server, and you might be right! However, I can also use this server
for other projects. Having a server that I manage allows me to build low-scale
projects just for myself in the spirit of [this
post](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/). I've set up
[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to sync files across all of my devices, and
have ideas for future projects that this enables. Having a personal server feels
empowering, and I recommend it for any software engineer looking for
side-project inspiration.

## Initial setup

The server came with Alma Linux, which is fine. In the future it'd be nice to
run NixOS.

The first thing I did to set up the server was install
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com). After installing, I used `ufw` to block
public network access, so that the server would only allow connections from
inside the Tailscale network.

I also installed Docker and Nix. Docker for the Jellyfin server, and Nix for my
download script (more on this later).

## Setting up Jellyfin

Jellyfin was trivial to set up with Docker Compose. I created a
`docker-compose.yml` with the following content, and started the service with
`docker compose up -d`.

```yml
services:
  jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin/jellyfin
    container_name: jellyfin
    network_mode: 'host'
    volumes:
      - /root/jellyfin/config:/config
      - /root/jellyfin/cache:/cache
      - /media:/media
    restart: 'unless-stopped'
```

Importantly, `/media:/media` creates a bind mount, binding the `/media`
directory on the host to the `/media` directory in the container. When I
download episodes, I can put them on `/media` on the host for the Jellyfin
server in the container to serve them.

After starting the container, I could access my media server from a browser on
any of machines connected to my Tailscale network:

## Accessing the media server on iOS

To access the server on my phone, I installed Tailscale and a Jellyfin client.
After trying a few Jellyfin clients, I landed on
[SenPlayer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/senplayer-hdr-media-player/id6443975850),
which has a nice UI and an option to continue playing media in the background
and when the screen locks.

## Downloading episodes

Next, I had to download the show episodes. With only 100GB of storage, I
couldn't download the entire show, and wanted a tool to allow me to easily
pre-download episodes into the media server. For example, after finishing
episode 10, I'd like to easily download episodes 11â€“20.

A web app would be cool, but probably overkill. In theory, I'd only be using
this tool a few times, a few months between each use. A script would be enough
to accomplish this.

After a few iterations, I ended up with [the script
here](https://github.com/debashisbiswas/critical-role-dl/blob/main/download.sh).
To be honest, I probably should have used something other than bash for this,
but it's good for the purpose it serves. I use this script by `ssh`ing into the
machine whenever I'm close to finishing the episodes I've downloaded.

The script uses [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) for the TUI frontend
and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download episodes from
YouTube. `yt-dlp` has options for including
[SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) data, **allowing me to add chapter
data that Jellyfin can use to skip the intro sequence and intermission for each
episode**!

I also use `shell.nix` for dependencies. It's a nice balance for this
lightweight script: not a full Docker container, but enough to allow me to
manage dependencies in a sane way.

Here's a demo. I can select multiple episodes, but just download episode 12 here.

<script src="https://asciinema.org/a/720200.js" id="asciicast-720200" async="true"></script>

After running the script, I can see episode 12 in my Jellyfin library, with the
metadata (episode title, thumbnail, description) automatically added:

<Image src={episode12web} alt="Episode 12 in the web interface" />

It also shows on the mobile client:

<Image src={episode12mobile} alt="Episode 12 in the mobile app" class="w-full max-w-xs mx-auto block sm:max-w-sm" />

The YouTube playlist has videos in the middle of the playlist, like short
episodes where the players roll for new stats after leveling up. I wanted to see
these in the order they're presented in the playlist without throwing off the
episode numbers, as Jellyfin uses episode numbers to pull metadata. Luckily,
[there's a corner of the Jellyfin
docs](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/media/shows#show-specials) which
outlines how to do this by treating those episodes as "specials" and adding
metadata with an NFO file. The script handles this as well.
