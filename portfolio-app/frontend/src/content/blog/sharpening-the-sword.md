title: Sharpening the sword for a battle that never comes

I often notice this pattern in myself, but didn't have words for it until
recently.

The pattern is in continuously getting stuck in a search for better tools,
rather than doing things with my existing tools. Looking for better processes. A
nicer text editor. Optimized productivity workflows and apps. Reading books
around those methods.

The pattern is _sharpening the sword for a battle that never comes_.

I find this pattern exhausting, but often have troubling preventing myself from
getting pulled in. Thinking about doing something is often easier, and can feel
nicer, than actually doing the thing itself.

There are a few areas in which this issue is most prominent for me:
- Note-taking apps
- Productivity systems
- Programming languages
- Text editors

Exploration isn't inherently problematic. However, it's an issue when I find
myself in seasons of my life in which I'm *only* exploring, and not capitalizing
on any of the knowledge I've accumulated so far. It's a problem of balance.

One heuristic I use to catch myself is noticing when I get into the theory of a
field. While I do enjoy studying theory, this is often an indication that the
balance is in question, especially when it's outside of my primary field. I can
justify computer science books, but how much should I really be studying the
theory of note-taking? Or rather, do I really want to be studying this?

I don't have a clear solution for this yet, but it helps to focus on the outputs
rather than the inputs. What am I trying to accomplish? What are my goals? It's
difficult to improve tools, processes, and knowledge "in general", because
without a direction, it's not easy to know when a something is truly an
improvement.
