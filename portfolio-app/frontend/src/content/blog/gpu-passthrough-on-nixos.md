  Running a Windows 11 virtual machine on NixOS with near-native performance
  using GPU passthrough
---

Last week, I set up GPU passthrough on NixOS, enabling me to run a Windows 11
virtual machine with near-native performance! This post is an overview of the
process.

## Why?

I recently wanted to try writing a Skyrim mod. My mod idea was beyond the scope
of most Skyrim mods: it would make network calls, dynamically create items in
the world based on those results, etc.

While Linux gaming has come far, some of the more involved tools for Skyrim
modding only support Windows. To my surprise, this was a barrier for me - I
don't have a single Windows machine around anymore! I run NixOS on my desktop
and laptop and stopped dual-booting years ago. 

This left me with a few options. I could either

- Set up dual-boot again
- Get all of Skyrim's modding tools working through Wine
- Set up a Windows VM with GPU passthrough

Dual-booting would be easiest, but I stopped doing it in the first place because
I found it annoying to reboot into a different operating system whenever I
wanted to use a different application. The Wine route didn't sound appealing,
and I got [nerd-sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by the potential of GPU
passthrough.

## Setting up the virtual machine

While most posts on this topic start by setting up GPU passthrough first and the
VM second, I started by setting up the VM first. I was hoping that I could get
by with a basic VM with no passthrough. Skyrim's an old game, and I remember
running it 10 years ago on a weak laptop with integrated graphics. Perhaps a VM
on modern hardware would be enough!

Setting up a VM isn't too difficult on NixOS, but it helps to understand how it
works. Linux virtualization has many moving parts, so here's a high-level
overview:

**KVM** (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a hypervisor built into the Linux
kernel, allowing the OS to take advantage of hardware virtualization features.

**QEMU** (Quick Emulator) actually handles creating and running VMs, and can
pair with KVM to take advantage of hardware. It also supports **virtio**, which
allows the guest OS to communicate with the host through paravirtualized
drivers. This means that rather than emulating an entire disk drive or network
card, the guest can use the drivers to talk directly to the host for this
functionality. This makes things _fast_.

**libvirt** provides a nice abstraction over many virtualization platforms,
including QEMU/KVM.

**virt-manager** is a GUI tool on top of libvirt, allowing us to manage VMs
similar to applications like VirtualBox.

There's also **OVMF**, which allows the VM to use UEFI. This is helpful for GPU
passthrough.

Here's the corresponding NixOS config, which I broke out into a separate module:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  virtualisation = {
    libvirtd = {
      enable = true;
      qemu = {
        package = pkgs.qemu_kvm;
        ovmf.enable = true;
        swtpm.enable = true;
      };
    };
  };

  users.users.violet.extraGroups = [ "libvirtd" "kvm" ];
  environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.virt-manager ];
}
```

The only piece that I didn't mention is `swtpm`, which allows the VM to emulate
a TPM. The Windows 11 installer wants to see a TPM when checking hardware
compatibility. Other than this, the rest of the VM setup was straightforward:

- Install the [Windows 11
ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11) and add it to
a virtual disk drive
- Install the [virtio drivers
ISO](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Windows_VirtIO_Drivers) and add them to a
second disk drive
- Configure the main disk and network card to use virtio
- During the install, Windows 11 tries to force you to sign in with a Microsoft
account. You can bypass this by disabling the network adapter, hitting `Shift +
F10` to open a command prompt, and typing `oobe\bypassnro` to reboot with the
option to skip online sign in. Coincidentally, [I read this morning that
Microsoft is disabling this
feature](https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/microsoft-eliminates-workaround-that-circumvents-microsoft-account-requirement-during-windows-11-installation),
so you may need to do some registry edits to get this to work.
- After installing the OS, install [SPICE Guest
Tools](https://www.spice-space.org/download.html) in the guest for better
display support, clipboard sharing, etc
  - This is probably less necessary when going for GPU passthrough, but I didn't
    know how far I was planning on going

## Setting up GPU passthrough with VFIO

This got me a nice Windows VM, but it was still far too slow for testing things
out in Skyrim, so I decided to continue setting up GPU passthrough. There were a
few guides that helped me through this process:

- [PCI passthrough via OVMF - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF)
- [A GPU Passthrough Setup for NixOS (with VR passthrough too!)](https://astrid.tech/2022/09/22/0/nixos-gpu-vfio/)
- [Windows-on-NixOS, part 2: Make it go fast!](https://nixos.mayflower.consulting/blog/2020/06/17/windows-vm-performance/)
- [Notes on PCI Passthrough on NixOS using QEMU and VFIO](https://alexbakker.me/post/nixos-pci-passthrough-qemu-vfio.html)

My dedicated graphics card is an RX 580, and I have integrated graphics on my
i7-7700T. GPU passthrough is much easier if you have more than one graphics
card, because it's easiest to give the VM full ownership of your passthrough GPU
rather than trying to share it between the host and the guest.

### Enabling IOMMU

GPU passthrough uses VFIO, a Linux kernel driver that allows userspace programs
(like QEMU) to access PCI devices like a GPU. To use VFIO, I needed to enable
IOMMU, which ensures that passthrough devices operate within safe boundaries.
This was quick in NixOS:

```nix
boot.kernelParams = [ "intel_iommu=on" ];
```

If you have an AMD CPU, this will be `amd_iommu`.

After a rebuild and reboot, I used the following command to check messages from
the kernel and confirm that IOMMU was enabled.

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep -i iommu
```

```
[    0.000000] Command line: initrd=\EFI\nixos\l5q5mzranynx29kl5mfr9p9r6ljxjrmr-initrd-linux-6.12.18-initrd.efi init=/nix/store/c91cmpkrzsmai5kx426clw6mhfa2bfk5-nixos-system-lumine-25.05.20250309.e3e32b6/init intel_iommu=on loglevel=4

[    0.260440] iommu: Default domain type: Translated
[    0.260443] iommu: DMA domain TLB invalidation policy: lazy mode
```

IOMMU puts PCI devices into groups. Everything in an IOMMU group must be passed
through as a unit. With IOMMU enabled, I needed to check the groups to make sure
my RX 580 wasn't grouped with anything else.

The Arch wiki includes a nice script for checking IOMMU groups:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
shopt -s nullglob
for g in $(find /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/* -maxdepth 0 -type d | sort -V); do
    echo "IOMMU Group ${g##*/}:"
    for d in $g/devices/*; do
        echo -e "\t$(lspci -nns ${d##*/})"
    done;
done;
```

But it wasn't returning anything!

```
IOMMU Group .:
```

I needed to enable VT-d (Intel's IOMMU) in the BIOS. After doing so, the output
of each command looked better!

```

From this, I can see the IOMMU group that contains my RX 580:

```
IOMMU Group 1:
	00:01.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 6th-10th Gen Core Processor PCIe Controller (x16) [8086:1901] (rev 05)
	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Ellesmere [Radeon RX 470/480/570/570X/580/580X/590] [1002:67df] (rev e7)

```

But what's this? I expected two devices in this group - the graphics and the
audio - but there are three! Depending on motherboard and CPU, the PCIe slot
itself may be in the group. This is okay, and I can still pass the GPU devices
to VFIO. The script shows the devices IDs that I need to pass: `1002:67df` for
graphics and `1002:aaf0` for audio.

### Passing the GPU through using VFIO

Now that I set up IOMMU correctly and could see my IOMMU groups, I could pass
the GPU through using VFIO. Note that I load VFIO modules before regular
graphics modules so that VFIO can bind to the card first.

```nix
{
  boot = {
    initrd.kernelModules = [
      "vfio_pci"
      "vfio"
      "vfio_iommu_type1"

      "i915"
      "amdgpu"
    ];

    kernelParams = [
      "intel_iommu=on"
      "vfio-pci.ids=1002:67df,1002:aaf0"
    ];
  };
}
```

I rebuilt the config, but before rebooting, I set up another monitor and plugged
it into my motherboard so that I could see my host through the iGPU. After VFIO
claims the dGPU, the host wouldn't be able to use it!

I rebooted... and the operating system was freezing during boot! Nothing was
showing up on my second monitor, either. Oops.

Thanks to NixOS, I could boot into a previous generation of the system and
debug! Eventually, I found that there was another BIOS setting which determined
if the motherboard should use the iGPU, dGPU, or both. It was currently set to
use the dGPU, so I changed it to use both.

This worked! I was able to see my host on my secondary monitor, and configure
virt-manager to pass my GPU through to the VM.

The VM had difficulty booting due to the hardware change, so I had to use the
virtual display to walk it through some restarts. After that, I installed AMD
drivers in the VM, and I could see Windows on my primary monitor! I suspect most
guides don't cover this part because they usually install the guest operating
system after passthrough is already set up.

To my surprise, sound was already working! Both the graphics and audio were
passed through, so the monitor was automatically used as my audio output. I keep
my speakers plugged into my monitor so that it's the audio output for whatever
the monitor is displaying (useful for switching between my desktop and work
laptop), so sound was working without any extra configuration!

## Final touches

virt-manager makes it easy to pass through USB devices. I was able to pass a
keyboard and Steam Controller through without issue. Both worked as expected with
no extra configuration - after installing Steam on the guest, I could use Steam
Controller shortcuts to open Big Picture mode, adjust audio, and navigate
through Steam.

The VM felt smooth, but was still struggling to launch Skyrim. Task Manager
reported that the VM was only seeing one logical processor, as I had used the
default CPU topology when I set everything up with virt-manager. My i7-7700T has
4 cores and 8 threads, so I gave the VM 2 cores and 4 threads.

## Result

This made everything incredibly smooth. I was able to open up Skyrim on my
ultrawide, playing fullscreen on my 3440x1440 monitor with a Steam Controller.
It felt native! I always think of VMs as slow because of my past experience with
them, so using a VM at near-native performance was incredible.

Here's the final config for my virtualization module:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  boot = {
    initrd.kernelModules = [
      "vfio_pci"
      "vfio"
      "vfio_iommu_type1"

      "i915"
      "amdgpu"
    ];

    kernelParams = [
      "intel_iommu=on"
      # RX 580 graphics and audio
      "vfio-pci.ids=1002:67df,1002:aaf0"
    ];
  };

  virtualisation = {
    libvirtd = {
      enable = true;
      qemu = {
        package = pkgs.qemu_kvm;
        ovmf.enable = true;
        swtpm.enable = true;
      };
    };
  };

  users.users.violet.extraGroups = [ "libvirtd" "kvm" ];
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    virt-manager
    pciutils
  ];
}
```

## Keeping GPU passthrough disabled

For now, I've decided to disable GPU passthrough. I want to keep my host using
the dGPU where possible, but that gets complicated when VFIO steals it even when
I'm not using the VM. Also, enabling both the iGPU and dGPU is causing severe
visual issues in Hyprland, but I don't want my machine to only use the iGPU and
have the dGPU sitting there unused most of the time.

I'm sure I could figure these out with more time. For example, it looks like
there's already some prior art on [single GPU
passthrough](https://github.com/joeknock90/Single-GPU-Passthrough). but I need
to get some other work done :)

Temporary disabling this is also easy in NixOS! I just commented out the
relevant config and can uncomment it when I'm ready to continue working on it.
Here's my module for now.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  boot = {
    # initrd.kernelModules = [
    #   "vfio_pci"
    #   "vfio"
    #   "vfio_iommu_type1"
    #
    #   "i915"
    #   "amdgpu"
    # ];

    kernelParams = [
      "intel_iommu=on"
      # RX 580 graphics and audio
      # "vfio-pci.ids=1002:67df,1002:aaf0"
    ];
  };

  virtualisation = {
    libvirtd = {
      enable = true;
      qemu = {
        package = pkgs.qemu_kvm;
        ovmf.enable = true;
        swtpm.enable = true;
      };
    };
  };

  users.users.violet.extraGroups = [ "libvirtd" "kvm" ];
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    virt-manager
    pciutils
  ];
}
```

## Conclusions

- Single GPU passthrough seems interesting
- [Looking Glass](https://looking-glass.io/) seems even more interesting
- NixOS is great! Having multiple generations of the system made it easy to
experiment safely, and being able to disable everything temporarily without
losing my progress for later is nice
- I need to take more pictures and screenshots during projects like this!
