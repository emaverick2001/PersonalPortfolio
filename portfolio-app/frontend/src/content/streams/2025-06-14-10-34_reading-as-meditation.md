A common meditation exercise is to remain focused on your breath. As your mind
wanders, you guide your focus back. Each time you do this, you get a bit better
at directing your focus.

The breath isn't the only thing you can focus on! I go through a similar process
while reading: focusing on the content of the book, feeling my mind wander, and
bringing it back. Music practice is a similar experience.

Meditation is everywhere.
