Welcome to the stream: short thoughts that I think would be useful to share.
These aren't as long or polished as blog posts, meaning they're a smaller
commitment for me to post. Hopefully, this means I'll do it more often.

Why not Twitter? On my own website, I have more control over the way everything
is presented, formatted, and organized. Here, I can build a workflow that makes
sense for me. It's more personal, for both me and anyone reading.

This page also mirrors how I took notes in Obsidian for a while. I wrote a
shortcut so that I could quickly append a new note with the current date to the
top of one long Markdown file. I called this note "stream" and each note within
it a "swirl", in reference to [Swirls of the
Stream](https://youtu.be/gjWRmoFIjjw).

Here are some of the resources that inspired me to start this:
