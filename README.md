## 🔨 Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow

Here's a clearer and more straightforward guideline of the steps for working with your codebase. If working in a small group or working on a simple project, some of the steps can be skipped.

1. **Create Issue**

   Before starting, open a new issue in the repository detailing what you plan to implement. Assign the issue to yourself.
2. **Sync Repo**

   Update your local repository to match the latest version of the remote repository.
3. **Create Branch**

   Create a new branch for your task. Name it appropriately based on the type of task, such as `feature/feature-name`, `bug/bug-name`, or `exp/exp-name`.
4. **Implement Code**

   Work on your task and make necessary changes to the codebase.
5. **Test Locally**

   Run tests using tools like mypy, pytest, and pre-commit. Ensure all tests pass before proceeding.
6. **Change Commit**

   Add and commit your changes to the branch, then push the branch to the repository.
7. **Create PR**

   Open a Pull Request (PR) for the branch you've pushed.
8. **Link PR to Issue**

   In your PR, include "Closes #ISSUE_NUM" to link it to the original issue.
9. **Pass Continuous Integration**

   Ensure all GitHub Actions checks pass. If they fail, revise your code based on the errors reported.
10. **Review PR Checklist**

    Verify that all items in the PR checklist are completed, such as updating documentation or adding package requirements.
11. **Ask for Code Review**

    Invite a colleague to review your PR. One approved, Use the "Squash and Merge" option to merge your PR, ensuring a clean commit history.
12. **Troubleshooting**

    If you break down the commit history or main branch, contact the repository owner for assistance with `rebase` or other needed actions.

## 💼 Template Structure

The current project template supports the final package release of our codebase.

## ❓ Issue & Pull Request

An issue typically describes a new feature (`feature`), fixing an old bug (`bug`), launching a group of experiments (`exp`), or refactoring part of the code (`refactor`). Using different issue templates for different issues.

A PR typically implements the content mentioned in one issue.

Notice about the development:

1. When creating an issue, assign the responsible member for fixing that if possible
2. When creating a PR, make sure you uses `feature/feature-name`, `bug/bug-name`, `exp/exp-name` for its branch
3. When finishing one PR, make sure all the github action is passed and all the checks are done.
4. When merging one PR, make sure using `squash and merge` instead of `merge a pull request`.
5. Avoid making any direct commit to the `main` branch and try to avoid any `--force` push to any branch unless you are pretty sure about that.

## 👷 Type Checking

- Tools

  - static type checking (`mypy`)
  - dynamic type checking (`beartype`)
- Guidelines

  - Run `mypy --strict ./` under the root of the current repo to test the static type.

## 🏅️ Unit Testing

- Tools

  - testing code components based on testing function (`pytest`)
- Guidelines

  - Run `pytest` under the root of the current repo to check unit test results.

## 🧐 Code Spell Checking

- Tools

  - code spell checking (`codespell`)
- Guidelines

  - Commonly need to ignore part of the files in the repository like `/data`.

## 🪝 Pre-commit Hook

- Tools

  - code formatting (`prettier`)
  - import package sorting (`isort`)
  - ipynb output clear (`nbstripout`)
  - code bug checking (`ruff`)
- Guidelines

  - Run `python -m pip install pre-commit` to install `pre-commit`
  - Run `pre-commit install` to allow hooking pre-commit with any `git commit` commands.
