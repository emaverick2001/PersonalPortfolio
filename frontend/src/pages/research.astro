        My research interests lie at the intersection of <strong>Graph Neural Networks</strong>, <strong
        >Agentic AI Systems</strong>, and <strong>Data Engineering</strong>. I’m drawn to problems that require bridging
        structured data processing with intelligent reasoning systems — enabling more robust,
        personalized, and explainable learning experiences. My current work spans from graph-based
        retrieval systems to data automation pipelines for clinical research.

    <h2 class="mb-2 mt-12 font-sans text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">
      U Lab — Graph Neural Networks & Intelligent Systems
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Directed by <strong>Professor Jiaxuan You</strong>, U Lab focuses on leveraging Graph Neural
      Networks for reasoning, representation learning, and multi-hop knowledge access. Our work
      explores how graph structure can enable models to move beyond static prompts and towards
      structured, explainable intelligence.

    <h3 class="mb-2 font-sans text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">TinyTutor (Ideation)</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      TinyTutor is an early-stage research project that explores how graph-based reasoning can
      support <strong>adaptive tutoring systems</strong>. The core idea is to create a
      graph-enhanced backbone that links concepts, dependencies, and skill progressions — enabling a
      small language model to act as an interactive, concept-aware tutor. I’m currently designing
      the system architecture, retrieval pipeline, and evaluation framework for multi-hop question
      answering and content personalization.

    <h2 class="mb-2 font-sans text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">
      Center for Psychedelic & Consciousness Research (CPCR)
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      At <strong>Johns Hopkins CPCR</strong>, my work centers on automating and scaling clinical
      research data workflows — from ingestion to reporting. CPCR conducts world-leading psychedelic
      clinical trials, aiming to uncover therapeutic mechanisms and expand responsible psychedelic
      science. My contributions focus on building reliable, reproducible systems to support
      researchers and clinicians.

    <h3 class="mb-2 font-sans text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">QA Library</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      A centralized Python library that automates scoring for over <strong
      >100+ questionnaires and psychometric measures</strong
      > used in CPCR studies. It ensures reproducibility, version control, and harmonization of data
      across multiple clinical protocols.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 font-sans text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">PHI Redactor</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      A pipeline that <strong>automatically detects and redacts Protected Health Information (PHI)</strong
      > from unstructured text and tabular datasets. This enables compliant downstream processing and
      model training on de-identified data.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-2 font-sans text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">Data Catalog System</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      An internal data management platform for organizing, distributing, and versioning scored study
      datasets. This tool integrates tightly with the QA Library, AE/PD report generator, and other
      automation scripts to reduce manual overhead in research workflows.

    <h3 class="mb-2 font-sans text-xl font-bold tracking-tight">
      Protocol Deviations + Adverse Events (AE/PD) Automation
    </h3>
    <p class="mb-6">
      A RedCap-based automation pipeline that ingests adverse event and protocol deviation data,
      parses and harmonizes it, and generates <strong>human-readable HTML reports</strong> for IRB and
      clinical teams. This reduced manual reporting time and improved standardization across studies.

      Toscano Lab — Reactive Sulfur Species Chemistry
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      In <strong>Toscano Lab</strong>, I contributed to experimental research investigating the
      chemistry and biological roles of <strong>hydropersulfides</strong>. Our work focused on
      developing reagents and methods to understand protein persulfidation and its biochemical
      effects.
